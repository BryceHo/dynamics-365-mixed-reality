# Install, open, and sign in to Dynamics 365 Product Visualize

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

To get the full benefits of Microsoft Dynamics Product Visualize, you'll need a Dynamics 365 account. When you sign in with your Dynamics 365 for Sales account, Product Visualize automatically connects to your Dynamics 365 for Sales opportunities.

> [!TIP]
> If you just want to explore sample 3D content, you don’t need a Dynamics 365 account. For more information, see [Explore sample 3D models](explore-samples.md).
 
## Install the app

1.	Go to the Apple Store.

2.	Search for “Dynamics 365 Product Visualize”.

3.	Download and install the app.

## Two ways to open and sign in

You can open and sign in to Product Visualize on your iOS device in two different ways:

- Open the app on your iOS device like you would any other app, and then sign in.
- Select any 3D model (GLB file) in your Dynamics 365 for Sales opportunity.

> [!NOTE]
> At this time, Product Visualize is available for iOS devices only.

## Open the app on your iOS device and sign in for the first time

1.	On your iOS device, search for “Dynamics 365 Product Visualize”, and then open the app.

2.	On the **Welcome** screen, select **Sign in**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > After you sign in for the first time, this screen will not appear again.

4.	On your first sign-in, you're prompted to select your Dynamics 365 for Sales organization. You can change organizations later, if you want, through **Account Settings**.

    > [!TIP]
    > If your organization isn’t set up with Dynamics 365 for Sales, you can explore sample models or go to the [Dynamics 365 for Sales website](https://trials.dynamics.com/Dynamics365/Signup/sales) to learn how to sign up.  

5.	On the **My Open Opportunities** screen, select the opportunity you want to work on.

    Product Visualize pulls in your opportunities from Dynamics 365 for Sales by default. You can also view followed opportunities and connect opportunities.
    
## Sign in from Dynamics 365 for Sales

You can also open Product Visualize directly from Dynamics 365 for Sales on your iOS device. This makes it easy to visualize your products in 3D as you work with your sales opportunities. 

If you haven’t already installed Product Visualize on your iOS device, you can install it from Dynamics 365 for Sales.

### Sign in from Dynamics 365 for Sales for the first time

1.	Open one of your opportunities in Dynamics 365 for Sales.

2.	Select the **Product Visualize** tab.

    - If you're using an iOS device, but the app isn't already installed, select **Learn More**, follow the instructions to install the app, and then sign in to the app using the instructions in step 5 of this procedure.
