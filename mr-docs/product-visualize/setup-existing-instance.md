# Set up Dynamics 365 Product Visualize on an existing Dynamics 365 for Sales instance

You can connect Microsoft Dynamics 365 Product Visualize to a new or existing Dynamics 365 for Sales instance. This topic explains how to set it up on an existing Dynamics 365 for Sales instance. If you don't already have Dynamics 365 for Sales, you can set up a free trial. For more information, see the [Setup topic](setup.md). 

## Minimum requirements

Existing Dynamics 365 for Sales instances must meet the following minimum requirements to connect to Product Visualize:

- The Dynamics 365 for Sales version must be 9.0 or later.

- Server-based SharePoint document management must be enabled.

- Products associated with 3D models must be in the GLB format.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Server-based SharePoint integration is the preferred method for integrating Dynamics 365 for Sales with SharePoint. You can't use the SharePoint List Component with SharePoint Online. Product Visualize does not support existing instances that use the List Component.

### Verify the Dynamics 365 for Sales version

1. In a browser window, go to your organization's Sales or Sales Hub instance [https://\<org name>.crm.dynamics.com]().

2. In the upper-right corner of the screen, select the **Settings** button, and then select **About**.

## Set up SharePoint document management

   > [!NOTE] 
   > If you already have server-based SharePoint integration enabled in your instance, you can skip this step.

### Enable SharePoint integration

1. In a browser window, go to your organization's Sales or Sales Hub instance [https://\<org name>.crm.dynamics.com]().

2. Select the **Settings** button in the upper-right corner of the page, and then select __Advanced Settings__.

3. In the navigation bar at the top of the page, select the down arrow next to __Settings__, and then select __Document Management__.

4. Select __Enable Server-Based SharePoint Integration__ to set up the connection to SharePoint.

5. Continue through the setup. When prompted, enter the URL for your SharePoint site: ([https://\<org name>.sharepoint.com]()).

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Be sure to enter the full URL for your SharePoint site, including `https://`.

6. When complete, return to the __Document Management__ settings page, and then select __Document Management Settings__.

7. Enter the URL for your SharePoint site if it isn't filled in by default, and then select __Next__.

8. Continue through the setup using the default values for the remaining options.

   Dynamics 365 will automatically create SharePoint folders for the Dynamics 365 for Sales entities. 

9. Close the window when you're done.

### Grant SharePoint permission

1. Go to your trial's SharePoint site: [https://\<org name\>.sharepoint.com]().

2. In the upper-right corner of the page, select **Share site**.

3. In the **Share** window, search for the group you created earlier, and then select the group name to add it to the site.

4. Grant the group Edit permission by selecting the small arrow under the group name.

5. Select **Share** to finish granting group access to SharePoint.

## Add 3D models to your products

1. In a browser window, go to the Sales or Sales Hub application, and then in the left navigation, under **Collateral**, select **Products**.

2. Open a product by selecting the product name.

3. On the __Related__ tab, select __Documents__ to go to a view of the SharePoint document location for that product.

4. In the __Open Location__ drop-down list, select __Documents on Default Site 1__ to open the SharePoint location outside of Dynamics 365 for Sales.

5. Drag and drop your model file (as a GLB file) into this location. It will automatically show up in Product Visualize.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > SharePoint folders are created when you first visit a product's documents through the Dynamics for Sales interface. Once the folder has been created, you can access the folder directly from the SharePoint site.

6. Optional: SharePoint automatically provides a thumbnail for Product Visualize; however, if you want to add an optional custom thumbnail to a model, drag and drop a PNG image with the same name as the model. Example: "ModelName1.png" is a custom thumbnail for "ModelName1.glb"

## What's next?
You're now ready to use Product Visualize with all of your sales opportunities. The Product Visualize mobile app can be downloaded from the iOS App Store. Users can sign in with the same Azure Active Directory credentials that they use to connect to Dynamics 365 for Sales.
