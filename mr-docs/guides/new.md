### June 3, 2019

Dynamics 365 Guides app version 103.1905.31001 introduces an improved anchoring (alignment) experience for Dynamics 365 Guides in preview. The PC app doesn’t require you to choose an anchoring method before creating a guide so you can start creating content right away. You can also switch between anchoring methods after creating a guide. The PC app also provides better step-by-step guidance for choosing the appropriate method for anchoring mixed reality instructions to your workspace.

If you choose to create a guide using a digital anchor, you can now use a pre-set 3D model, so you don’t have to choose a 3D model 
before proceeding.

> [!NOTE]
> To take advantage of the new anchoring improvements, you must update the Dynamics 365 Guides (Preview) solution in the Dynamics 365 
admin center. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mixed-reality/guides/upgrade" target="_blank">Upgrade your Dynamics 365 Guides (Preview) solution</a> or contact your Dynamics 365 administrator.

For more information on authoring a guide with the PC application, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mixed-reality/guides/pc-authoring" target="_blank">Use the PC authoring application to create a guide</a>.
