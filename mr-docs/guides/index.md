Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides in preview is a mixed-reality application for Microsoft HoloLens that enables employees to learn in the flow 
of work by providing holographic instructions when and where they need them. A series of step-by-step instruction cards 
with image and video support are visually tethered to the place where the work needs to be done. Additional guidance 
in the form of holographic models shows what needs to be done where, so workers can get the job done faster, with fewer errors 
and greater retention of learned skills. 

## Easily create mixed reality guides without the need for specialized skills

<!--note from editor: Suggest adding hyphen to "mixed reality" in heading above but didn't add myself in case it would break a link   -->

Dynamics 365 Guides allows anyone to structure and create step-by-step mixed-reality guidance for a task, without the need for specialized 3D or programming skills. Start with the PC authoring tool to capture work processes and create guides—files 
that include step-by-step instructions with images, video, and 3D holograms. After creating the guide on a PC, authors 
can then connect the instruction cards and holograms to the physical work space using HoloLens by picking them up and 
moving them to the right location. Use the default library of 3D holograms or import your own custom 3D models if you prefer.   

## Improve productivity by enabling your workforce to learn while doing their work

Training typically occurs away from the flow of work in a training facility and requires a buddy system with experienced 
mentors to bring workers up to speed on the production line. Some complex procedures are not needed regularly, and just-in-time training is needed even for experienced workers. Currently, task cards and standard operating procedures are typically done on paper or a 2D device that requires a user to read, process, and then do, leaving a gap between learning and doing. 

Whether it’s doing complex procedures on the job or while training away from the production line, Dynamics 365 Guides provides heads-up, hands-free, 
step-by-step instruction in the flow of work. Employees can control the interface with their gaze (using a glance to move to the next 
step) leaving their hands free to do the work. Instruction cards move with the worker, following them as they move around equipment, 
pointing to the tools and parts they need and showing them exactly how and where to apply them. The experience is comfortable, 
simple to use, and reduces mental processing time, errors, and the need to rely on a buddy system. 

## Continually analyze and improve your processes   

Using Power BI dashboards, managers can see rich data about how the process is working for their people, enabling them to continually 
analyze and improve without doing expensive studies. Being part of the Dynamics 365 product family and powered by Common Data Service, Dynamics 365 Guides allows customers and partners access and integration opportunities.
