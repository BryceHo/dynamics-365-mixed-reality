# Upgrade the Dynamics 365 Guides (Preview) solution (for admins)

This topic is for [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-dyn-365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)] administrators. Some releases of [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] require an update to the [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides-preview](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides-preview.md)] solution. When an update is required, the user will see a notification in the **What's new** panel.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Keep the following in mind:<br><br>- Before updating the solution in the [!include[pn-dyn-365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)] Administration Center, make sure that the [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] PC and [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] apps have been updated to the latest version from the [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] Store.<br><br>- Updates to the solution must be done when the PC and [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] apps are not in use.  

To upgrade the solution:

1. Go to the [Dynamics 365 administration center](https://port.crm.dynamics.com/G/Instances/InstancePicker.aspx), and then sign in with 
your administrator credentials (the credentials you created when you signed up for the preview, if 
you created a new environment). 

2. Select the **Instances** tab, and then choose an instance that has the [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides-preview](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides-preview.md)] solution installed.

3. Select the small edit button next to **Solutions** to see the list of solutions.
