# Work with Dynamics 365 Guides

The 3D models prepared with [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-dyn-365-import-tool](../includes/pn-dyn-365-import-tool.md)] can be used in [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)]. To import them, youâ€™ll need to locate the 3D model file and place it using the [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] PC authoring app.

Files created with [!include[pn-dyn-365-import-tool](../includes/pn-dyn-365-import-tool.md)] are stored locally in C:\Users\\[username]\3D Objects\Microsoft Layout. 

To find the files on your local drive using the [!include[pn-dyn-365-import-tool](../includes/pn-dyn-365-import-tool.md)] user interface:

1.	Open [!include[pn-dyn-365-import-tool](../includes/pn-dyn-365-import-tool.md)].

2.	Right-click the model, and then select **Open file location**.  

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Locate file](media/locate-model.PNG "Locate file") 
  
3.	Browse to this location when you're ready to [import your own custom 3D objects in the PC authoring app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/mixed-reality/guides/pc-authoring#import).
